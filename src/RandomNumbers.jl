## return a random sample from a chi square distribution
## with the specified degrees of freedom
function chi_square(dof)
    return gamma(0.5 * dof, 0.5)
    # This was corrected from gamma(0.5, 2.0*dof) in the original code
end

## return a random sample from a beta distribution
function beta(a, b)
    if (a <= 0) || (b <= 0)
        error("Beta parameters must be positive")
    end

    ## There are more efficient methods for generating beta samples.
    ## However such methods are a little more efficient and much more complicated.
    ## For an explanation of why the following method works, see
    ## http://www.johndcook.com/distribution_chart.html#gamma_beta

    u = gamma(a, 1.0)
    v = gamma(b, 1.0)
    return u / (u + v)
end
